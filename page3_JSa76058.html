                <p>The first page of this website contains three forms. Each form takes data inputed by the user and passes it to a function in JavaScript.
                     The first form is supposed to validate information relating to the experience level of the user and then recomend a video for them to watch.
                     Unfortunately, I was unable to get both to work simultaneously. <small>(Below are a few snippets of code)</small></p>

            <section class="part_2">
                <p>The second page of the website incorporates a few neat tricks you can do with JavaScript. The first is the user-controlled flexbox, which uses
                     a select input to run a function in JavaScript and update the style in CSS. The second is a moving image that changes location when the user’s
                      mouse hovers over it. The third feature on the second page was supposed to be a hidden treasure chest that appears when clicked, but sadly I
                       did not have enough time to make it work. <small>(Below are a few snippets of code)</small></p>
                    <div id="snippetContainer2">
                       <div class="snippet2Item">
                           <img src="images/codeSnippet3_JSa76058.JPG" alt="Snippet of code" id="snip3">

                       <div class="snippet2Item">
                           <img src="images/codeSnippet4_JSa76058.JPG" alt="Snippet of code" id="snip4">

            <section class="part_3">
                <p>The third page, the current one, might not appear like much at first, but it uses responsive design like each of the other pages.
                     That means the content adjusts depending on the size of the user’s screen. Go ahead and try it! Inspect the page, 
                     then use the device toolbar! <small>(Below are a few snippets of code)</small></p>
